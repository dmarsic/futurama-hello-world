# futurama-hello-world

Sometimes you need a test program that will execute, let you know
that everything is running and exit with no other side-effect.
Basically a hello world program. But it doesn''t have to be the boring
old 'Hello World'.

Here is the shiny metal script that can be used for all your test
purposes. Or at least some of them.

## Usage

```
hello.py
```
